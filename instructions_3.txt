The result is very nice so far, thanks a lot. 
I have a few corrections and adjustments that I propose in the following. 
Some of the instructions are interconnected, so please make sure to interpret and execute them fully and holistically.

General:
- Fully move to Helvetica as the main font for all plots and remove all (EB) Garamond occurences 
- Make sure that the visual plot aligns with the "back-end plot", there was e.g. a mismatch of the fonts when downloading the plot

For the main plot visually:
- Please add a slightly visible edge to the plot
- The the inner grids should be a bit a more transparent
- There should be no margin for the first and last grids (before 2 and 8) on the x-axis
- The visual selection of the word bubble/dot (edge or frame around the word) should have less width and a bit more alpha 
- Only have one geom_vline() and geom_hline() respectively, with the grey color. For geom_hline have y = 0 and for the geom_vline have the global mean of the left-right self-placement (x axis) as the value

For the main plot conceptually:
- Make sure (this is important!), that it is possible to click on a word after one has initially selected a word and that it affects the drop-down menu selection, this should also be the case the other way around of course
- The top word selection should also feature the quadrant based top words (what I did in Figure 6 instead of Figure 5 in the paper)
- One should be able to select the number of global top words (as it is done right now) and the number of qudrant based top words (default should be 10)
- The main figure should display both global top words and quadrant based top words, but there should be no duplicates in the displayed data frame!
- Make sure that the combination of global top words and quadrant based top words makes sense and causes no problems. You can ask me in the process of creating it.

Top right word indication:
- By default non-political or non-ideological stopwords such as "stands" (stehen) or "more" (mehr) should be removed from the selection. Please lookup those f
- The dropdow word selection should also feature a search bar in the same UI element 
- Make sure that the selection of English/German/Both also (see the screenshot attached) should be correct and also update the search barplot
- Default should be "Both" 
- The "Both" button should be replaced with only buttons for German and English were both are clicked as default (which should mean "both")
- The options should also reactively update the search bar (English/German/Both words in the search bar and not only German!)
- Make sure to replace the blue color at the left end with the grey color. 
- All the 5 numbers displayed should be black, apart from left freq (which should be red) and right freq (which should be blue)

Right distribution plot:
- Add a little bit of space (not too much!) between the plot title and the distribution.
- The plot title should have the same format as the other visuals – ENGLISH WORD (GERMAN WORD), no quotation marks 
- Also include the annotated mean value for the semantically left and right words (the same as for the neutral words)
- Be sure to display the correct distribution, as I did it in Figure 7 of the paper. Maybe ask me during the code update, how to approach this and show me the ggplot2 functions you are using here.

General information and citation information: 
- In the very top right, make sure that the paper icon is preceeded by a "Please cite:" which should also mention that if people use the figures they should cite the paper!
- At the very bottom, below the the full citation and link add another paragraph where it is briefly (2-3 sentences) described how I generated the associations from the German candidate surveys (2013, 2017, 2021) using their open-ended survey responses and left-right self-placements. Look up the methods section of the paper for further details.
- At the bottom right, remove the "Data: 6661 unique words" statement.
